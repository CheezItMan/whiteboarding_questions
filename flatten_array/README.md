# Flatten Array

Write a program that will take a nested list and returns a single list with all values except nil/null
The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example:

input: [1,[2,3,nil,4],[nil],5]
output: [1,2,3,4,5]

You can run the tests on the code from the project folder with:

```bash
$  jasmine-node .
```
