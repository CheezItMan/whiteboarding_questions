# Whiteboarding Questions

The whiteboarding questions given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrvG5CJqOsjYFF5DenwRpZiB4rsIRxfzG50DdMpAz-8/edit#) have sample solutions posted in this repository.  They are JavaScript solutions and I encourage you to provide a pull request with Ruby versions.  

You can run the tests on the code from the project folders with:

```bash
$  jasmine-node .
```
